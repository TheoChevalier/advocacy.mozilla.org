copyright_email1_itstime=It's time to bring copyright laws into the 21st century. Sign the petition now.
photographing_the_eiffel_tower=Photographing the Eiffel Tower lights at night, remixing a song, making a meme. You may be surprised to learn all these actions may be illegal.
The_EUs_copyright_laws=The EU's copyright laws are currently a patchwork of good, bad and outdated policies. Right now, some large companies — like publishers and media outlets — are working to maintain these restrictions, or make them even tighter. We can’t beat overzealous copyright agitators with money — but we can beat them with help from people like you and common sense reforms. 
Thats_why_your_voice=That’s why your voice is so powerful in this moment — because most people don’t expect us to care about these laws. Will you prove them wrong and help to protect the memes, mixtapes, and mashups endangered by these laws?
Will_you_add_your_name=Will you add your name to the petition to update EU copyright laws for the 21st century?
Big_publishers=Big publishers, major rights holders, and other companies are lobbying the EU institutions to keep these outdated laws in force. Some are even trying to pass more stringent regulation charging search engines for linking to press content on the internet. Others want new laws that would mandate monitoring and filtering online.
We_need_law_changes=We need law changes to promote creativity and protect future forms of expression we haven't even thought of yet. Otherwise, some of our most beloved quirks of the 21st century could disappear. For me, this would mean losing those adorable memes — like dogs on skateboards! — that magically lift my mood.
Together_we_can=Together, we can protect creativity on the internet — in the 21st century and beyond. Will you sign?
Thanks_for_all_that_you=Thanks for all that you do
